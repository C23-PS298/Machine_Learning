# Bangkit Capstone C23-PS298 Machine Learning RepositoriesðŸ¥·
Hi folksðŸ‘‹
This repo contains our Machine Learning Training and Dataset that runs on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index)

## Library usedðŸ§©
- âœ…[Yolov8 Ultralytics](https://docs.ultralytics.com/) - used as the chosen framework for the object detection model.
- âœ…[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - used for utilized for coding the object detection system.
- âœ…[Numpy](https://numpy.org/install/) - used to perform a wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays.
- âœ…[Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install) - used as the underlying deep learning library.



## Process Flow of Object Detection DevelopmentðŸ”ƒ

The object detection flowchart begins with data acquisition and dataset creation. If videos are available, frames are extracted. Otherwise, captured frames/images are used directly. The YOLOv8 model detects objects in the frames/images and converts dataset annotations to a compatible format. The model is then trained to improve object detection. Detected objects are marked with bounding boxes during frame/image processing, and annotated frames/images are merged to generate the final video output. The flowchart concludes with the completion of the object detection process and video output generation.
